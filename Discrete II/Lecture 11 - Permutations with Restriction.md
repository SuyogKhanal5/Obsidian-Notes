 - ### Permutations without Repetitions
	 - ###### Ex. A math debating team consists of $4$ speakers
		 - In how many ways can the speakers be arranged in a row for a photo?
			 - 4 generators, $4$ options for the first, $3$ for the second, etc. $4!$
		 - How many ways can the captain and vice captain be chosen?
			 - Two generators, $4$ options for the first, $3$ for the second, $4 \cdot 3 = 12$
	- ###### Ex. There are $7$ horses in a race
		- In how many different orders can they finish?
			- $7$ generators, no repetition allowed, order matters, $7!$
		- How many trifectas are allowed?
			- $3$ generators, no repetition allowed, order matters, $7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = 210$

- ### Permutations with Restrictions
	- ###### Ex. How many ways can $5$ boys and $4$ girls be arranged on a bench if:
		- There are no restrictions?
			- $9!$
		- Boys and girls alternate?
			- We cannot start with a girl because otherwise we run out of girls before boys
			- First position must be a boy, we have $5$ choices from the boys
			- Next must be girl, we have $4$ choices from the girls
			- Then we need a boy, we have $4$ from the boys
			- $\vdots$
			- $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1$
		- Boys and girls are in separate groups?
			- Two subgroups, one for the boys and one for the girls
			- $5! \cdot 4!$ for the boys on the left, and $4! + 5!$ for the boys on the right
			- $2(5! \cdot 4!)$
		- Anne and Jim wish to stay together?
			- Anne and Jim can sit in any position $2 \cdot 8!$
	- ###### Ex. How many arrangements of the letters of $\text{REMAND}$ are possible if:
		- There are no restrictions?
			- $6!$
		- They begin with $\text{RE}$?
			- First two positions fixed, so $4!$
		- They *do not* begin with $\text{RE}$?
			- $6! - 4! = 696$
		- They have $\text{RE}$ together in order?
			- $5!$
	- ###### Ex. There are $6$ boys who enter a boat with $8$ seats, $4$ on each side. In how many ways can:
		- They sit anywhere?
			- $8$ choose $6$, meaning there are $\frac{8!}{(8-2)!} = \frac{8!}{6!} = 8 \cdot 7$
	- ###### Ex. From the digits $2,3,4,5,6$:
		- How many numbers greater than $4,000$ can be formed?
			- Any permutation of these $5$ numbers will give us a number $\ge 4,000$
		- How many $4$ digit numbers greater than $4,000$ can be formed?
			- Must start with digit $\ge 4$
			- $3$ options for first digit, $4$ options for the second one
			- $12$ numbers

- ### Permutations with Repetitions
	- ###### Ex. How many permutations of the word $\text{PARRAMATTA}$ are possible
		- The word is length $10$
			- Element $P$ appears once
			- Element $A$ appears four times
			- Element $R$ appears twice
			- Element $M$ appears once
			- Element $T$ appears twice
		- $10!$ assumes every element is unique, so we divide by the number of same elements' permutations: $\frac{10!}{1!4!2!1!2!} = 37,800$
	- ###### Permutation Repetition Formula
		- If we have $n$ elements, of which $x$ are alike of one kind, $y$ of another kind, $z$ of another kind, etc. Then the number of ordered selections is given by the formula $\frac{n}{x!y!z!}$
	- ###### Ex. How many different numbers can you make from $11122337$?
		- Length is $8$
		- Three $1$s
		- Two $2$s
		- Two $3$s
		- One $7$
		- $\frac{8!}{3!2!2!1!} = 1,680$
