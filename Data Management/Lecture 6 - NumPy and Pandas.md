- ### NumPy Basics
	- **ndarray** - $n$-dimensional array is core object
		- Arrays are homogenous, one data type for all elements
		- `np.array()`, `np.zeroes()`, `np.ones()`, `np.arrange()`
		- Attributes: `shape`, `size`, `dtype`
	- ###### Reshaping Arrays
		- Turn 1D array into 2D![[Pasted image 20241008155722.png]]
		- Flatten 2D Array![[Pasted image 20241008155739.png]]
	- ###### Array Operations
		- Element Wise - Add, Subtract, Multiply, element by element
		- Broadcasting - Operate on arrays of different sizes
		- Mathematical functions: `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.dot()` (matrix mult)
		- Slicing and Indexing similar to lists
	- ###### Internal Storage
		- Single contiguous block of memory
		- Bytes of each object determined by data type
		- Inherently one dimensional

- ### Pandas Basics
	- ###### Information
		- Single threaded
		- Memory efficient for large datasets, not for very large ones
		- I/O Handling
		- `axis=0` refers to rows, `axis=1` refers to columns
