- ### Types of Applications of Statistics
	- ###### Descriptive Statistics
		- Look for patterns
		- Summarize the information
		- Present the information
	- ###### Inferential Statistics
		- Utilize sample data
		- Draw conclusion about a larger set of data
		- Conclusion: estimates, decisions, predictions, etc.

- ### Examples of Practical Problems
	- ###### Mean Problem
		- Population: All Rutgers undergraduate students
			- About $35,000$ students
		- What is the estimated average SAT math score of all students?
	- ###### Proportion Problem
		- Population: A jar of m&m's from Costco
			- About $2,000$ m&m's in the jar
		- What is the proportion of m&m's in the jar that are red?
	- ###### Sampling Problem
		- Draw with/without replacement
	- Can you (or do you want to) enumerate the population?

- ### Parameter and Sample Statistic
	- In reality, true mean and SD are not known and need to be estimated
	- **Parameter**: a numerical descriptive measure of a *population*
	- **Sample statistic**: a numerical descriptive measure of a *sample*![[Pasted image 20231027122507.png]]

- ### Sampling
	- It is time, labor, and cost consuming to get data for the whole population
	- ###### Goal: Get a *representative* sample
		- Individuals selected are representative of a larger population in terms of key characteristics 
		- Truly representative sampling is extremely hard
	- Avoid biased sample
	- ###### Sampling design
		- Simple probability sampling
			- Random sample
			- Systematic sample
		- Stratified sampling
		- Cluster sampling
		- Multi-stage sampling
		- Multi-phase sampling

- ### Things to Avoid
	- ###### Selection bias
		- Use correct sampling strategy
	- ###### Non-response bias
		- Incentive for the survey
		- Weighting
		- Conduct non-response analysis
	- ###### Measurement error
		- Questionnaire design
		- Manipulative or ambiguous questions

- ### 1936 Presidential Election
	- ###### Literacy Digest
		- Predicted correctly presidential election winners since 1916
		- Predicted that Landon $57$% vs Roosevelt $43$%
	- Actual results: Landon $38$% vs. Roosevelt $62$%
	- ###### Literacy Digest's Downfall
		- Took samples from telephone directory, magazine subscribers, rosters of clubs and associations etc.
			- Selection bias
		- $10$ million sampled, $2.4$ million responded to the survey
			- Non-response bias

- ### Sampling Distribution
	- ###### Point Estimate
		- What you got from the sample
		- For example: One shovel has $\hat{p}=\frac{17}{50}=0.34$
		- Is point estimate enough? 
	- ###### Is the sample mean or sample proportion a constant or random variable?
		- Repeat the experiment again and again
		- They have distributions, called sampling distribution
	- Why do we care about the distribution?
	- ###### How can we get the distribution of sample mean/proportion?
		- Obtained by repetitive experiments
		- Can be theoretically derived
	- ###### What does the distribution depend on?
		- When repeating the experiment, can we take samples with different sample sizes?
	- Repeat experiment $33$ times, or $33$ shovels![[Pasted image 20231027124636.png]]
	- We then observe the summary statistics and distribution

- ### Virtual Shovel
	- Let computer do the shoveling
	- ###### Population: Saved in data "bowl" (`moderndive` package)
		- In reality, population isn't known (most of the time)
		- Each observation has `ball_ID` and `color`
		- Distribution of color
			- Population proportion $p=\frac{900}{2400}=0.375$
			- Population size $N=2400$
	- ###### Function to take random sample
		- `rep_sample_n(size,reps)`
			- `size`: The number of balls to shovel each time
			- `reps`: The number of times to repeat the experiment
		- `rep_sample_n(size=50, reps=1000)` will return
			- $50 \cdot 1000 = 50,000$ observations
			- $\forall$ reps from $1,2,\dots1000$ has $50$ samples each with corresponding `ball_ID` and `color`
			- Can get the proportion of red from each rep and then summarize it
	- ###### Results 
	- For `size` $= 25, 50, 100,$ and $400$![[Pasted image 20231027125644.png]]
	- For `size` $= 100,$ repeat $400, 600, 800, 1000$ times![[Pasted image 20231027125831.png]]

- ### Center and Spread
	- ###### Distribution
		- Mean: Center of Distribution
		- Standard Deviation: Measures the spread of the distribution![[Pasted image 20231027130357.png]]
	- Observe the shape of the distribution, where the center is, and the spread with different sample sizes

- ### Conclusions
	- ###### The average of the sample population is close to the proportion population
		- Sometimes $\hat{p}$ is larger, sometimes $\hat{p}$ is smaller than the true population proportion, but on average it is close enough
	- ###### The variance of the sample population depends on the sample size
		- The larger the sample size, the smaller the variance

- ### Statistical Terminology and Conclusions: Sampling Distribution of $\bar{X}$
	- ###### Mean: Mean of the sampling distribution equals mean of the population $\mu_{\bar{X}} = E(\bar{X}) = \mu$
		- We say $\bar{X}$ is an unbiased estimate of $\mu$
	- ###### Variance: Variance of the sample distribution equals the variance of the population divided by sample size. $\sigma^2_{\bar{X}}=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$
		- The Standard Deviation is called standard error of the mean
		- $\sigma_{\bar{X}}= \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
		- Standard Deviation vs. Standard Error
	- True for any distributions
	- $\hat{p}$ is the mean of dummy indicators
	- If the sample size $n$ is large enough, the distribution is approximately normal (Central Limit Theorem)

- ### Accuracy and Precision
	- **Accuracy**: The estimate is on target
		- $\hat{p}$ is unbiased, it is an accurate estimate
	- **Precision**: "Consistency" (How variant the estimate is)
		- Large sample size will yield precise estimates![[Pasted image 20231027131510.png]]
