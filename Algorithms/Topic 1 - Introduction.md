- ### What is an Algorithm?
	- Step by step instructions to solve a problem
	- Any problem that can be solved by a Turing Machine is considered computable
	- Algorithms + Data Structures $=$ Programs

- ### Characteristics of a Good Algorithm
	- Faster
	- Less Memory
	- Lesser Resources
	- Accurate
	- Scalable
	- Robust
	- Fair

- ### Greedy Algorithms
	- Make the best local choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum
	- ###### Ex. Activity Selection Problem
		- Goal: Select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities
		- Greedy Approach: Always pick the activity that finishes earliest

- ### Dynamic Programming
	- Break down a problem into overlapping sub problems, solve each just once and store their solutions\

- ### NP Hardness
	- Problems where if someone gives you a solution you an quickly check whether it is correct or not

- ### Random Algorithms
	- Algorithms that use randomness as apart of their logic
	- Often provide simpler and faster solutions than deterministic ones

- ### Approximation Algorithms
	- Algorithms designed to find near optimal solutions to its optimization problems where finding the exact solution is impractical
