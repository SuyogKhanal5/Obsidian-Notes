- ### Proof by Contrapositive
	- To prove $P \Rightarrow Q$
		- Prove that $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$
		- Assume $\neg Q$ is true and show that $\neg P$ follows logically
			- i.e., we will *assume the opposite of our desired conclusion* and show that this opposite conclusion *could never be true* in the first place 

- ### Proof by Case Analysis
	- We hate absolute values so we want to avoid them
		- We can do this with proof by case analysis

- ### Proof by Contradiction
	- To prove $P$ you prove that if $P$ is false it would lead to a ridiculous result, and therefore $P$ must be true
		- Assume $P$ is false
		- Logically deduce something that is known to be false
	- Whenever we see in the problem that there are an infinite amount of something, that's our clue to use proof by contradiction
