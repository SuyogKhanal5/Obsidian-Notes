- ### Residual
	- ###### Ideal case
		- Symmetric bell shaped
		- Random, no obvious patterns
	- ###### Assumptions of regression
		- Normally distributed 
		- Mean 0
		- Constant variance
		- Independent
	- Normal distribution

- ### Probability Distribution
	- Gives the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes
	- ###### Discrete: Probability Mass Function (PMF)
		- Positive: $f(x) \ge 0$ $\forall x$
		- Total Probability 1: $\sum f(x) = 1$
		- Probability at given point: $P(X = x) = f(x)$
	- ###### Continuous: Probability Distribution Function
		- Positive: $f(x) \ge 0$
		- Total probability 1: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx=1$
		- Probability at an interval: $P(a \le x \le b) = \int_{a}^{b}f(x) dx$
		- Probability at any given point: $P(x=a) = 0$

- ### Binomial Distribution
	- ###### Bernoulli Trial
		- Random experiment with two possible outcomes (dichotomous response)
		- Probability of success: $p$ 
			- Success is what event you are interested in 
		- $P(X=1)=p$, $P(X=0)=1-p$
	- ###### Binomial Distribution
		- A sequence of $n$ independent Bernoulli Trials with the same probability of success $p$
		- Interested in: The number of successes $X = k$
		- $X$~$B(n,p)$
		- $P(X=k) = {n \choose x} p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$
	- Typical example: Number of heads when flipping quarters

- ### History of Normal Distribution
	- ###### De Moivre
		- Binomial Expansion
		- Binomial distribution converges when $p = \frac{1}{2}$ to something bell shaped and symmetric
	- ###### Laplace
		- Generalized to any $0 < p < 1$
		- Calculated normalization constant
		- De Moivre-Laplace Central Limit Theorem
	- ###### Gauss
		- Use bell shaped symmetric curve as a distribution of random error, correctly determined orbit of Ceres
		- It had been called Laplace distribution, Gauss distribution, Laplace-Gauss distribution, until it was eventually called normal distribution

- ### Normal Distribution
	- Bell-Shaped and Symmetric
	- Most prominent probability distribution
	- Many phenomena generate random variables that are approximately normal
	- ###### Probability Density Function (PDF)
		- $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$, $-\infty < x < \infty$
		- Mean: $\mu$, Variance: $\sigma^2$
		- Standard Normal: $\mu = 0$, $\sigma^{2}= 1$
			- Standard Normal table
	- ###### Properties of Normal Distribution
		- Its a PDF 
			- Total Integral 1, approaching 0 at either end
		- Symmetric 
			- Mean, median, mode all at $x = \mu$
		- Bell Shaped
			- Points of inflection at $x = \mu \pm \sigma$
		- Empirical Rule
			- Approximately 68% of all measurements fall within 1 SD of the mean
			- Approximately 95% of all measurements fall within 2 SD of the mean
			- Approximately 99.7% of all measurements fall within 3 SD of the mean
		- IQR/SD is approximately 1.35 ![[Pasted image 20230922131538.png|500]]
	- ###### Checking Normal Distribution
		- Formal statistical test
		- QQ Plot
			- `ggplot(data=df, aes(sample=x)) + stat_qq() + stat_qqline_()`
			- If it is a normal distribution it will mostly be a straight line
			- Life Expectancy vs GDP per capita QQ Plot ![[Pasted image 20230922131649.png|500]]

- ### R functions for probability distribution
	- Binomial: `pbinom`, `qbinom`, `dbinom`, `rbinom`  
	- Normal: `pnorm`, `qnorm`, `dnorm`, `rnorm`  
	- $p$: probability  
	- $q$: quantile  
	- $d$: distribution density  
	- $r$: random sampling  
	- $(d, p, q, r)$ apply to all statistical distributions in R
