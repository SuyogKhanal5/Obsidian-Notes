- ### Two Types of Statistical Inference
	- ###### Confidence Interval
		- Don't know population parameters
		- Want to estimate them
	- ###### Hypothesis Testing
		- Don't know the population parameters
		- There are some statements about the parameters
		- Want to decide whether agree or disagree

- ### HT: Intuition
	- Car manufacturer: MPG has mean $27$ and standard deviation $3$, and is approximately normally distributed
	- You: Bought a car with 20 MP, do you believe the manufactures claim?
	- What manufacture claimed: Null Hypothesis
	- ###### How to make decision?
		- Calculate a probability $P(X<20)$ if true mean is $27$
			- What is this probability?
		- Probability large or small?
			- How small is considered small?
		- What is your conclusion?
	- ###### One more thing
		- You should have *a sample* instead of a single observation
			- If you have $49$ cars with a mean $26$ MPG, do you believe the manufacturer's claim?

- ### Hypothesis
	- **Statistical Hypothesis**: A statement about the numerical value of a *population* parameter
		- Ex. The mean of the volume of the bottle is $16$ oz.
	- **Null Hypothesis**: $H_0$
		- Commonly the hypothesis that will be accepted unless the data provides convincing evidence that it is *false*
	- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a$
		- Could be the opposite of null hypothesis, or not. But mutually exclusive.
		- Will be accepted only if the data provides convincing evidence that it is *true*
		- Also called research hypothesis
	- ###### Hypothesis and court trial
		- Court trial: presumption of innocence
			- One is considered innocent until proven guilty
			- Null hypothesis: Not guilty
			- Alternative hypothesis: guilty
		- Statistical hypothesis
			- Don't reject null unless sample data is very unlikely to happen

- ### One-sided vs. Two-sided Test
	- Also called one-tailed or two-tailed
	- Examples
		- $H_{0} : \mu = 16$ $H_{a} : \mu < 16$
		- $H_{0} : \mu = 16$ $H_{a} : \mu > 16$
		- $H_{0} : \mu = 16$ $H_{a} : \mu \ne 16$
		- $H_{0} : \mu \le 16$ $H_{a} : \mu > 16$
		- $H_{0} : \mu \ge 16$ $H_{a} : \mu < 16$

- ### Formulating Hypothesis
	- ###### Hypothesis
		- Null and alternative
		- One-sided and two-sided
	- ###### Question 1
		- Formulate a one-sided or two-sided test
		- Direction of comparison
	- ###### Question 2
		- Which one to put as null, which one to put as alternative?
	- ###### Rule of thumb
		- Pay attention to the direction of comparison
		- Put what the sampling experiment is intended to establish as the alternative
		- Put the status quo as the null
		- Put equality sign ($\le$, $\ge$, $=$) in the null

- ### Results of Hypothesis Testing
	- Reject the null / Fail to reject null
		- We don't say "we accept the null"
	- How to make decision?
	- ###### Test Statistic
		- A sample statistic used to decide between the null and alternative hypothesis
		- Computed from information in the sample
		- Function of sample mean, sample proportion, sample mean difference, sample proportion difference
	- ###### Rejection Region
		- The set of possible values of the test statistic for which the null hypothesis will be rejected![[Pasted image 20240417194254.png]]

- ### Type I and Type II Error
	- ###### Type I error:
		- The null is rejected when it is in fact true
		- False positive
		- $\alpha = P(\text{type I error})$
	- ###### Type II error
		- The null is accepted while it is in fact false
		- False negative
		- $\beta = P(\text{type I error})$

- ### Significance Level and Power
	- ###### Significance Level
		- A fixed probability of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis, if it is in fact true
		- Threshold of making errors
		- Equals Type I error
		- Usually chosen as $0.05$
	- ###### Power
		- Measures the test's ability to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false
		- Equals 1 - Type II error
		- Ideally we want a test to have high power, close to 1

- ### P-Value
	- The probability of getting a value of the test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than that observed by chance alone, if the null hypothesis is true
	- ###### Comparison of $p-$value and significance level
		- $p-$value $<$ significance level: The result is significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected
		- Equivalently to have a rejection region such that type I error is the significance level
