- ### Multinomial and One Way Chi-Squared Test
	- Multinomial distribution
		- Extension to binomial (with $k$ levels)
	- How to test the proportions in each category?
		- One way chi-square test
	- ###### Conditions
		- Multinomial experiment (random sample)
		- Same size is large (each expected count $\ge 5$)
	- ###### Hypotheses
		- $H_{0}:p_{1}=p_{1,0},\dots p_{i}-p_{i,0},\dots p_{k}=p_{k,0}$
		- $H_{a}:$ At least one of the probabilities is not the hypothesized value

- ### One Way Chi-Squared Test in R
	- ###### Teaching score example
		- Is it true that equal number of teaching track and tenure track faculties, and number of tenured faculties doubles that for tenure track?
		- $H_{0}:p_{1}=\frac{1}{4}, p_{2} = \frac{1}{4},p_{3} = \frac{1}{2}$
	- Observed counts![[Pasted image 20240426134711.png]]
	 - ###### Simple function in R
		- `countrank <- table(evals$rank) chisq1 <- chisq.test(countrank, p=c(1/4, 1/4, 1/2)`
	- $\text{Expected counts} = \text{total count} * p_{i,0}$
		- `chisq1$expected$`![[Pasted image 20240426134723.png]]
	- Check expected counts to make sure that they are larger than 5
	- Check $p-$value to see if you can reject null![[Pasted image 20240426134737.png]]

- ### One Way Chi-Squared Test: More
	- When $k=2$, this is binomial
		- $H_{0}: p_{1} = p_{1,0}, p_{2,0} \Leftrightarrow H_{0} : p_{1} = p_{1,0}$
	- ###### Promotion example
		- Proportion of promoted $= 70$%
		- Proportion of not $= 1-70=30$%
		- Chi-Squared $p=0.6592$
	- ###### Chi-Squared Test and One Sample Proportion $z$ test
		- Chi-Squared is two tailed
		- $z$ test can be one tailed or two tailed
		- They are equivalent for two tailed test

- ### Two Way Contingency Table
	- Data is classified according to two criteria (two scales, dimensions, classifications)
	- ###### Two types of contingency table
		- One margin is fixed (predetermined sample size in one dimension)
			- Test of homogeneity
		- Neither margin is fixed (data can be simultaneously classified)
			- Test of independency
		- Tested same way

- ### Two Way Chi-Squared Test
	- ###### Conditions
		- Multinomial experiment (random sample) in two dimension
		- Same size is large (each expected count $\ge 5$)
	- ###### Hypothesis
		- $H_{0}:$ The two classifications are independent
		- $H_{a}:$ The two classifications are dependent
	- `chisq <- chisq.test(evals$rank, evals$gender)`
	- $\text{Expected counts} = \text{row total} * \text{column total} / \text{total count}$
		- Make sure $\ge 5$
	- `chisq2$expected$`

- ### Two Way Chi-Squared Test: More
	- When $2 \times 2$ contingency table
	- $H_{0}:$ The two classifications are independent $\Leftrightarrow H_{0}:p_{1}=p_{2}$
	- ###### Promotion Example
		- 2 levels in decision, 2 levels in gender
		- Decision and gender are independent $\Leftrightarrow$ the proportion of men who got promoted is the same as the proportion of women who got promoted
	- ###### $2 \times 2$ contingency table
		- Chi-squared test: Two tailed test
			- Expected counts $\ge 5$
		- Two sample proportion difference $z$ test: can be one tailed or two tailed
			- Number of successes in each sample $\ge 15$
		- Equivalent to two tailed $z$ test

- ### More on Chi-Square Independence Test
	- Reject the null: association/correlation doesn’t mean causal relationship
	- Fail to reject: doesn’t mean accept the null

- ### More on Contingency Table
	- ###### Conditions
		- Multinomial experiment (random sample) in two dimensions
		- Sample size is large (each expected count $\ge 5$)
	- ###### What if conditions are not satisfied?
		- Not random independent sample
			- Paired sample $2 \times 2$ contingency table: McNemar's test
		- Sample size small
			- $2 \times 2$ contingency table: Fisher's exact test
