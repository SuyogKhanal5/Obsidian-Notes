- ### Frequentist Inference
	- Probability equivalent to frequency
	- Draw conclusion from sampled data
	- Ex. We flip a coin, if we flip it over and over again eventually 50% of the coins will be heads
	- But what about predicting things like election results? We can't repeat the election

- ### Bayesian Inference
	- Probability as the relative probability of the event
	- Hypothetical repetitions (elections with similar circumstances)
	- ###### Logic of Bayes
		- Prior: Unconditional probability (assumption)
		- Evidence: Something observed
		- Posterior: Conditional probability for the event
		- Prior $+$ Evidence $\rightarrow$ Posterior
		- It can be sequential![[Pasted image 20250905084542.png]]
