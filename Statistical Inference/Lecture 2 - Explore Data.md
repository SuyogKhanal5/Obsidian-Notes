### Data Types and Structures in R
- ###### Data Types
	- Character
	- Numeric
	- Integer
	- Logical
	- Complex
- ###### Data Structures
	- Vector
	- List
	- Matrix
	- Data Frame

### Data Tidying
- 80% of data analysis is spend on cleaning and tidying data
- Tidy datasets are all alike, but messy ones are all messy in their own way
- ###### Characteristics of Tidy Data:
	- Each variable forms a column
	- Each observation forms a row
	- Each type of observational unit forms a table

### Data Wrangling
- Data munging
- Transform and map data from raw data into another format
- Filter
- Group, sort, arrange, summarize
- Mutate/transform
- Merge
- Pipe operator (%>%)

### Data Visualization
- Graphical representation of data
- ###### Grammar of graphics
	- Map data variables to aesthetic attributes of geometric objects
	- Geometric objects: points, bars, lines, etc.
	- Aesthetic attributes: x/y position, color, shape, size, etc.
- Art and science
- ###### Types of graphs
	- Categorical data: Bar graph, pie chart  
	- Numerical data: Histogram, boxplot  
	- Multivariate: Scatterplot, line, map  
	- 5NG (5 named graphs): scatterplot, line, histogram, boxplot, bar graph
