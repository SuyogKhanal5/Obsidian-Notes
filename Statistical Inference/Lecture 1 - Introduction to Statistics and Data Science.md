	- Embraces uncertainty and approximation

### Data Science vs. Statistics
- Difference people have different views about their relationships
- ###### Statistics
	- Develop models using probability
	- Focus much more on quantifying uncertainty
- ###### Data Science
	- Bring modern computational infrastructures, large datasets, and algorithm design
	- Enable statistics to pursue new challenges
