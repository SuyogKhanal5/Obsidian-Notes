- ### Difference Method
	- To find the size of set $A$
		- Find a larger set $S$ such that $S = A \cup B$
		- $A$ and $B$ are both disjoint sets
		- $|A|=|S|-|B|$
	- ###### Ex. Possible outcomes where white and black die have different values?
		- Find $S$ with all possible outcomes $|S|=36$
		- Subtract $B$ with the same values $|B|=6$
		- $|A|=|S|-|B|=36-6=30$

- ### Product Method
	- Gives us how many different elements are possible
	- The multiplication finds all the possible "matches" across sets
	- $|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B|$
		- This is true *even if $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint*
		- Useful when counting elements of a set involves dealing with tuples, sequences, or a series of choices
		- The elements of $A \times B$ are ordered pairs
		- General: $|A_{1} \times A_{2} \times \dots \times A_{n}| = |A_{1}| \cdot |A_{2}| \dots |A_{n}|$
	- ###### Ex. If I roll a white and black die, how many possible outcomes do I see?
		- $A=$ All outcomes of a black die
		- $B =$ All outcomes of a white die
		- All outcomes $=$ $|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B| = 36$
	- ###### Ex. A restaurant has a menu with 5 appetizers, 6 entrees, 3 salads, and 7 desserts. How many ways are there to choose a complete meal?
		- $A=$ Set of all appetizers
		- $E=$ Set of all entrees
		- $S=$ Set of all salads
		- $D=$ Set of all desserts
		- $|A \times E \times S \times D| =|A| \cdot |E| \cdot |S| \cdot |D|= 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 = 630$
	- ###### What if now I am allowed to skip some or all the courses?
		- We just add one extra element to each set
		- $|A \times E \times S \times D| =|A| \cdot |E| \cdot |S| \cdot |D|= 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 = 960$
