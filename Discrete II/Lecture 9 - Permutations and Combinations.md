- ### Permutations and Combinations
	- Many counting problems can be solved by finding the number of ways to arrange a specified number of distinct elements of a set of a particular size, where *the order of these elements matters*
		- We use **Permutations** here
		- Everything is considered a different element
	- Many other counting problems can be solved by finding the number of ways to select a particular number of elements from a set of a particular size, where *the order of the elements selected does not matter*
		- We use **Combinations** here
	- ###### Ex. Find the 4-digit permutations of the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5
		- We have 4 places to place the numbers: _ _ _ _
		- We need 3 random generators since the order that we pick them matters 
		- $4$ options for the first spot $3$ for the second spot, $2$ for the third, $1$ for the last spot, $4! = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24$
	- ###### Ex. What if I now want to find the total number of permutations involving the same numbers, but now we can reuse numbers
		- We now need 4 random generators, we have $4$ options for every digit
		- In this problem order is irrelevant, this is a combination problem
	- ###### Ex. How many different 5-card hands can be made from a standard deck of cards?
		- Order irrelevant since it doesn't matter what order we choose the cards
		- Repetition is not allowed too
		- $5$ spots for our $5$-card hand: _ _ _ _ _
		- $52$ possible cards
		- So we have $52! = 52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48 = 311,875,200$
		- But here we are overcounting, we are having order matter
		- To fix this, we need to divide by the number of hands by the number of permutations of cards: $5! = 120$
		- We have to do repeated subtraction for each group that overcounts, which is why we divide
		- $\frac{52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48}{5!}=2,598,960$
	- ###### Combination Formula
		- $P{n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$
		- We have $n$ objects and we want to choose $k$ of them
	- ###### Permutations Formula
		- $P_{k}^{n}= \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
		- We have $k$ different places to put any of $n$ objects
