- ### Combinatorial Proofs
	- In general, to give a combinatorial proof for a binomial identity, say $A=B$, you must do the following:
		- *Find a counting problem* you will be answer in two ways
		- Explain why one answer to the counting problem is $A$
		- Explain why the other answer to the counting problem is $B$
		- Since $A$ and $B$ are the answers to the same question, $A = B$ must be true
		- The hardest part is coming up with the question, becomes easier the more counting problems you solve
	- Hints for combinatorial proofs:
		- Define a set $S$
		- Show that $|S|=n$ one way
		- Show that $|S|=m$ another way
		- Conclude that $n=m$

- ### Combinatorial Proofs Examples
	- ###### Prove that ${n \choose k}={n \choose n-k}$
		- Define a counting problem
		- In this case counting problem, we are looking for the number of ways to select $k$ out of $n$ people
		- One way to count is ${n \choose k}$, which is the left hand side
		- Another way is to choose $n-k$ people to *NOT* select: ${n \choose n-k}$
		- Both of these solve the same problem, so therefore are the same
	- ###### How many $10$ letter words use exactly $4$ A's, $3$ B's, $2$ C's, and $1$ D?
		- One way 
	- ###### Prove that $1n+2(n-1)+3(n-2)+\dots+2(n-1)+1n={n+2\choose 3}$
		- Define problem: We need to count the number of ways to select $3$ things from a group of $n+2$ things
		- These things go from $1,2,3,\dots,n+2$
		- In other words we want to find $3$ element subsets of those numbers
			- Since order does not matter we consider subsets
		- Break this problem up into cases by what the middle number in the subset is
		- Say each subset is $\{a,b,c\}$ written in increasing order
		- We count the number of subsets for each distinct value of $b$
			- The smallest possible $b$ is $2$ and the largest is $n+1$
			- When $b=2$, there are $1 \cdot n$ subsets: $1$ choice for each $a$ and $n$ choices ($3$ through $n+2$ for $c$)
		- Therefore the total number of subsets is $1n+2(n-1)+3(n-2)+\dots+$ $2(n-1)+1n$ which is our left hand side
	- ###### Prove that ${n \choose 0}^2+{n \choose 1}^2+{n \choose 2}^2+\dots+{n \choose n}^2={2n \choose n}$
		- Define the question: How many pizzas can you make by using $n$ toppings when there are $2n$ toppings to choose from?
		- Left side: Divide the toppings into two groups of $n$ toppings (perhaps $n$ meats and $n$ veggies)
		- Any choice of $n$ toppings must include some number from the first group and some number from the second group
		- Consider all possible cases
			- $0$ meats: ${n \choose 0}{n \choose n}$, since you need to choose $0$ of the $n$ meats and $n$ of the $n$ veggies
			- $1$ meat: ${n \choose 1}{n \choose n-1}$
	- ###### Prove that $\sum^{n}_{k=0} {n \choose k}=2^{n}$
		- Let $S=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$
		- Counting pattern: How many subsets of $S$?
		- Right side: $2$ choices for each element
			- Number of subsets $=2^{n}$
		- Left side: Use partition rule
			- Count all subsets of size $0$ $\rightarrow {n \choose 0}$
			- Count all subsets of size $1$ $\rightarrow {n \choose 1}=\sum^{n}_{k=0} {n \choose k}$
			- Size $n \rightarrow {n \choose n}$
	- ###### Prove that $\sum^{\frac{n}{2}}_{k=0} {n \choose k}=2^{n-1}$
		- Let $S=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$
		- Counting pattern: How many subsets of $S$?
