- ### Types of Plots
	- ###### Univariate Plots (One variable)
		- Histogram
		- Boxplot
		- Bar Graph
	- ###### Bivariate Plots (Two variables)
		- Scatterplot
		- Line plot
		- Side-by-Side Boxplot
		- Side-by-Side Bar Graph/Stacked Bar Graph
	- ###### More Complex
		- Introduce size and color to scatterplot

- ### Skew
	- We call right skewed distributions graphs that have a tail leading to the right.
	- The distribution below is considered to be right skewed

### Mode
- ###### Single Mode
	- This is normally your typical bell curve

- ###### Multimodal
	- A graph that has multiple peaks and valleys

- ### Boxplots
	- We can see the skew with boxplots, but we cannot see how many modes we have

- ### Bar Graph
	- In a bar graph, each bar is a single value, whereas in a histogram each bar is an interval
	- Stacked Bar Graph and Side-by-Side Bar graph uses colors to show multiple bar graphs giving more information
	- ###### Stacked Bar Graph

	- ###### Side-by-Side Bar Graph

- ### Scatterplot
	- We can customize the color, size, and shape in order to add more variables in our scatterplot
