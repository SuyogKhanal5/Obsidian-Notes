- ### Singly Linked List
	- **Linked List** - Recursive data structure that is null or a reference to a node. It is a sequence of nodes joined together
		- First node is called the head
		- Last node is called the tail
	- **Node** - Data type that contains a reference to a node
	- Use a private nested class Node to implement the node abstraction. Start with nodes having two values, a string and a node
	- Linked List Example![[Pasted image 20231007175149.png]]
		- `first.next.item` will return "Bob"
	- Node Example ![[Pasted image 20231007175203.png]]
	- To create a linked list, you have to create and link each node one by one ![[Pasted image 20231007175241.png]]
	- ###### Standard operations for a linked list:
		- Add a node at the start
		- Remove and return the node at the beginning
		- Add a node at the end (requires a reference to the last node)
		- Traverse the list (visit every node, in sequence)
	- Remove and return the first node  ![[Pasted image 20231007175340.png]]
	- Add a node to the start ![[Pasted image 20231007175350.png]]
	- Visit every node ![[Pasted image 20231007175402.png]]
	- Maintain the pointer "first" to the first node in a linked list

- ### Doubly Linked List
	- A linked list where every node refers to its previous and its next nodes
	- Each node has three parts: data, a link to previous node, and a link to next node
	- Each end points to null ![[Pasted image 20231007175947.png]]
- ### Circular Linked List
	- The next node of the tail node leads to the first node
	- For doubly linked lists that are circular the previous node of the head leads to the tail 
	- Be careful iterating over these, you'll end up in an infinite loop ![[Pasted image 20231007180146.png]]
